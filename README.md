# ProClubs-Dashboard-project

# Introduction
Welcome to my Pro Clubs dashboard project. This project involved creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize player statistics from Pro Clubs. The primary goal was to gather, process, and transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling better analysis and strategic decisions for our club. The project included data transformation, calculated columns, and interactive visual elements, providing an intuitive and dynamic way to explore player performance data.
